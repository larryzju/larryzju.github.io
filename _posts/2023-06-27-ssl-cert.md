This doc shows you how to create a self-signed CA cert and sign new
certificate.

## create self-signed CA

generate RSA private keys for CA

    openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048

generate self-signed CA cert (input the fields in prompt)

    openssl req -new -x509 -key ca.key -out ca.crt 

## sign certificate with CA

generate RSA private keys for cert

    openssl genrsa -out larry.key 2048

prepare a CSR for certificate

    openssl req -new -key larry.key -out larry.csr

sign the cert

    openssl x509 -days 60 -CAkey ca.key -CA ca.crt -req -in larry.csr -out larry.crt

## verify certificate

The client might use client certificate to authenticate itself.

    openssl verify -CAfile ca.crt larry.crt

## create CSR from private key and existing cert

It\'s possible to generate the CSR from the existing cert

    openssl x509 -x509toreq -signkey ca.key -in ca.crt -out ca.csr

The CSR file can be viewed

    openssl req -in ca.csr -noout -text
